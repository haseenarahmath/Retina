    "The early 20th century brought forth a surge of interest from mathematicians, computer scientists, and neuroscientists in formalizing the notion of computability. These cross-disciplinary efforts yielded a slew of characterizations of computational systems such as the Turing Machine and the Lambda Calculus. One of the lesser known outcomes of this movement was a neuronal model proposed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. It served as the precursor to the neural networks and machine learning tools of today, and it exhibits surprising computational scope and power given its formal simplicity."

    "Simply put, a McCulloch-Pitts neuron consists of the following:\n",

    "1. A node having a specified *threshold* value.\n",
    "2. A finite, but unlimited, number of binary-valued inputs to the node. Each input is one of two types:\n",
    "    - *Excitatory* inputs contribute to the global excitation of a node. If the sum of the node's excitatory input values equals or exceeds the node's threshold, the neuron is considered to be activated and \"fires,\" outputting a value of 1. If, however, the total excitation falls below the threshold of the node, the unit does not fire and outputs 0.\n",
    "    - *Inhibitory* inputs impede neuronal excitation. If any of the inhibitory inputs transmits a value of 1, the neuron is considered to be inhibited and does not fire as indicated by its output value of 0.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Given this definition, four natural questions arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What types of functions is a network of McCulloch-Pitts neurons capable of computing?\n",
    "2. Is it possible to dispense with the inclusion of inhibitory inputs while retaining the same class of computable functions?\n",
    "3. Is the binary nature of the neuron's inputs an impediment to its computational breadth? In other words, can we extend the class of functions which the network is capable of computing by allowing the inputs (weights) of our network to take on arbitrary real values.\n",
    "4. Is their something to be gained by allowing for the *relative inhibition* of neurons, whereby inhibitory inputs merely decrease the total excitation of a unit without necessarily preventing it from firing altogether?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will provide an answer to each of these in the following sections of this tutorial. But first, let's take a look at how the McCulloch-Pitts neuron can be implemented in code. Retina provides its own `MPNeuron` and `MPInput` classes in the machine learning module. They are reproduced here."

For a proof of this, we will appeal to a standard result from propositional logic: namely, that any set of *adequate* connectives is sufficient for expressing any given truth table. It is well known that the binary boolean operators AND and NOT are adequate, so to show that any n-ary logical function can be expressed by some McCulloch-Pitts network, we need only show that we can devise neurons equivalent to the AND and OR operators.
